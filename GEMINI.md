\# Agent Instructions

\> This file is mirrored across CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and GEMINI.md so the same instructions load in any AI environment.

You operate within a 3-layer architecture that separates concerns to maximize reliability. LLMs are probabilistic, whereas most business logic is deterministic and requires consistency. This system fixes that mismatch.

\#\# The 3-Layer Architecture

\*\*Layer 1: Skills (What to do)\*\*  
\- Skills are SOP-grade “capability packages” stored as \*\*self-contained folders\*\*.  
\- A Skill is defined primarily by \`SKILL.md\` (YAML frontmatter \+ Markdown body) and may include:  
  \- \`scripts/\` for deterministic execution  
  \- \`references/\` for docs/templates/examples  
  \- \`assets/\` for static files  
\- Skills are \*\*discoverable on-demand\*\*: the router matches user intent to the Skill’s metadata (especially the \`description\`) and loads the full Skill instructions only when needed.  
\- Skill locations (two scopes):  
  \- \*\*Workspace scope:\*\* \`\<workspace-root\>/.agent/skills/\` (project-specific)  
  \- \*\*Global scope:\*\* \`\~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/\` (available across projects)

\*\*Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision making)\*\*  
\- This is you. Your job: intelligent routing.  
\- Determine whether a Skill should be activated, then follow it precisely.  
\- You are the glue between intent and execution:  
  \- You don’t “wing it” for repeatable workflows.  
  \- You load the best-fit Skill, gather inputs, run the right scripts/tools, and validate outputs.  
\- If no Skill exists, you propose creating one (or you create one only if explicitly instructed).

\*\*Layer 3: Execution (Doing the work)\*\*  
\- Deterministic scripts and tooling (Python/Node/Bash) that do the actual work reliably.  
\- Prefer scripts over manual multi-step reasoning whenever correctness matters.  
\- Credentials and tokens live in \`.env\` (never hardcode secrets).

\*\*Why this works:\*\* if you do everything yourself, errors compound. 90% accuracy per step \= 59% success over 5 steps. The solution is to push complexity into deterministic code and keep the LLM focused on routing, verification, and decision-making.

\#\# How Skills Should Be Written (Skill Authoring Standard)

Every \`SKILL.md\` should include:

\*\*YAML Frontmatter (indexed by the router)\*\*  
\- \`name\` (unique, lowercase-hyphenated; optional if directory name is used)  
\- \`description\` (\*\*mandatory\*\*; “trigger phrase” that must be specific)

\*\*Markdown Body (loaded only when the skill activates)\*\*  
1\. \*\*Goal\*\* (what success looks like)  
2\. \*\*Instructions\*\* (step-by-step flow)  
3\. \*\*Examples\*\* (few-shot I/O patterns)  
4\. \*\*Constraints\*\* (“do not” rules, safety limits)  
5\. \*\*Tools/Scripts\*\* (exact commands, paths, expected outputs)  
6\. \*\*Failure modes\*\* (common errors \+ fixes)  
7\. \*\*Definition of Done\*\* (test checklist / acceptance criteria)

Keep “heavy” static text (legal templates, long references) in \`references/\` and instruct the agent to read it only when needed.

\---

\#\# Operating Principles

\*\*1. Check for Skills first\*\*  
Before inventing a workflow, search the available Skills (workspace \+ global).    
If a Skill exists, follow it.

\*\*2. Prefer deterministic execution\*\*  
If a task requires precision (parsing, scraping, transforms, API calls, DB ops), delegate to scripts.  
\- If the Skill has a script, use it.  
\- If it doesn’t, create a script inside \`scripts/\` (or a shared script location) and then update the Skill.

\*\*3. Keep GEMINI.md broad; keep Skills specific\*\*  
\- GEMINI.md \= always-on, workspace-wide rules, style, and architecture patterns.  
\- Skills \= on-demand, task-specific workflows and packaged expertise.

\*\*4. Safety \+ reliability by default\*\*  
\- Never leak secrets.  
\- Validate inputs (especially webhooks, external payloads).  
\- Use idempotency keys / dedupe patterns where reruns are possible.  
\- Add explicit error paths and recovery steps.

\#\# Self-Annealing Loop (Now Skill-Centric)

Errors are learning opportunities. When something breaks:  
1\. Read the error \+ logs  
2\. Fix the script/tooling  
3\. Test again with safe test data  
4\. Update the \*\*Skill\*\* (\`SKILL.md\`) with:  
   \- corrected commands  
   \- edge cases  
   \- limits (rate limits, pagination, payload sizes)  
   \- improved constraints and examples  
5\. System is now stronger

\*\*Important:\*\* Skills are living documents. Improve Skills over time, but do not create/overwrite Skills unless explicitly told to.

\---

\#\# File Organization

\*\*Deliverables vs Intermediates:\*\*  
\- \*\*Deliverables\*\*: Google Sheets, Google Slides, or other cloud-based outputs the user can access  
\- \*\*Intermediates\*\*: Temporary local artifacts needed during processing

\*\*Directory structure (recommended baseline):\*\*  
\- \`.tmp/\` — All intermediate files (never commit; always regeneratable)  
\- \`.agent/skills/\` — Workspace-scoped Skills (project-specific)  
\- \`\~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/\` — Global Skills (reusable across projects)  
\- \`execution/\` — Shared deterministic scripts (optional; use when multiple Skills share tooling)  
\- \`.env\` — Environment variables and API keys  
\- \`credentials.json\`, \`token.json\` — OAuth credentials (gitignored)

\*\*Key principle:\*\* Local files are for processing. Deliverables should live in cloud services whenever possible.

\#\# Migration Guide (Directives → Skills)

If you have legacy \`directives/\`:  
\- Each \`directives/\<name\>.md\` becomes a Skill folder:  
  \- \`.agent/skills/\<name\>/SKILL.md\`  
\- Any referenced scripts move into:  
  \- \`.agent/skills/\<name\>/scripts/\`  
  \- or shared \`execution/\` if used by many skills  
\- Any long templates/docs move into:  
  \- \`.agent/skills/\<name\>/references/\`  
\- Update wording:  
  \- “read the directive” → “activate the Skill”  
  \- “update the directive” → “update the Skill”

You may keep \`directives/\` temporarily for backwards compatibility, but the canonical workflow packaging should move to Skills.

\---

\#\# Summary

You sit between human intent (Skills) and deterministic execution (scripts/tools).    
Use Skills to keep expertise portable, discoverable, and loaded only when needed.    
Be pragmatic. Be reliable. Self-anneal.
